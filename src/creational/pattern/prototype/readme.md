# Prototype Design Pattern

**Cloning of an existing object instead of creating new one and can also be customized as per the requirement.**

This pattern should be followed, if the cost of creating a new object is expensive and resource intensive.

**Advantage of Prototype Pattern**

- It reduces the need of sub-classing.
- It hides complexities of creating objects.
- The clients can get new objects without knowing which type of object it will be.
- It lets you add or remove objects at runtime.

**Usage of Prototype Pattern**

- When the classes are instantiated at runtime.
- When the cost of creating an object is expensive or complicated.
- When you want to keep the number of classes in an application minimum.
- When the client application needs to be unaware of object creation and representation.
