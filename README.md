# Design Pattern

## Creational Pattern

**Way of creating objects**

1. [Singleton](https://github.com/kumarsudarshan/design-pattern/tree/master/src/creational/pattern/singleton)
2. [Factory Method](https://github.com/kumarsudarshan/design-pattern/tree/master/src/creational/pattern/factory)
3. [Abstract Factory Method](https://github.com/kumarsudarshan/design-pattern/tree/master/src/creational/pattern/abstractfactory)
4. [Builder](https://github.com/kumarsudarshan/design-pattern/tree/master/src/creational/pattern/builder)
5. [Prototype](https://github.com/kumarsudarshan/design-pattern/tree/master/src/creational/pattern/prototype)

## Structural Pattern

**How classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures.
Pattern simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships.**

1. [Adapter]()
2. [Bridge]()
3. [Composite]()
4. [Decorator]()
5. [Facade]()
6. [Flyweight]()
7. [Proxy]()

## Behavioral Pattern

**The interaction and responsibility of objects. The interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they 
can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.**

1. [Chain of Responsibility]()
2. [Command]()
3. [Interpreter]()
4. [Iterator]()
5. [Mediator]()
6. [Momento]()
7. [Observer]()
8. [State]()
9. [Strategy]()
10. [Template]()
